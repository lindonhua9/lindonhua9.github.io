about: |
  I am a Ph.D candidate in the Computer Engineering department at Stony Brook University with extensive experience in software development and distributed systems engineering, having successfully implemented scalable, IoT-based health monitoring infrastructures. My current research focuses on multimodel data fusion and AI-driven neurotechnology solutions, including advanced machine learning platforms integrating EEG signals and facial recognition for early detection of command-following behaviors in traumatic brain injury patients. My interdisciplinary approach bridges software engineering expertise and innovative computational methods to enhance clinical neuroscience applications and improve patient care.
