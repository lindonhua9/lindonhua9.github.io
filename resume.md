## Research Experience

### Research Assistant at Stony Brook University

**Project: Multimodal Brain-Behavior Detection in Disorder of Consciousness (09/2023 - Present)**  
- Designing a Python-based neurotechnology platform using machine learning and signal processing to detect command-following behaviors in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients.
- Employed a machine learning facial recognition algorithm to track micro-expressions indicative of voluntary movements, achieving earlier detection.
- Proposed an LSTM-based model for EEG signal analysis, reaching 80% accuracy on healthy control subjects.

**Project: Scalable Home-Based Health Monitoring Infrastructure (10/2022 - 08/2023)**  
- Engineered a scalable, fault-tolerant IoT-based health monitoring system using Python and Node.js.
- Developed a data-agnostic pipeline using publishâ€“subscribe mechanisms, significantly reducing configuration efforts.
- Ensured high availability with InfluxDB and MySQL, maintaining 24/7 uptime with less than 1% data loss.

**Project: Radar-based Non-contact Vital Signs Monitoring (01/2021 - 10/2022)**  
- Led development of an advanced radar signal processing system in Python for non-contact vital signs monitoring.
- Proposed a dynamic range-bin selection algorithm that improved the Periodic-to-Noise Ratio by 2 dB.
- Applied filtering techniques to reduce respiration error to 1.2 beats per minute.

### Research Scholar at Texas A&M University

**Project: Deep Learning for Monocular Depth Estimation (08/2018 - 06/2019)**  
- Developed a dilated fully convolutional neural network (CNN) using Python and PyTorch for monocular depth estimation.
- Implemented dilated convolutions to expand the receptive field, achieving a 7x reduction in parameters compared to VGG-16.
